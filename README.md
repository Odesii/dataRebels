# Data Rebels

In the sprawling neon-drenched metropolis that most dare to call "The World," the streets seethe with the dispossessed—the nameless drones and disenfranchised souls, each a mere cog in the gargantuan machinery of the omnipotent Corpo conglomerates. These faceless masses slog through their dreary lives, forgotten and downtrodden, while those cast out from even this meager existence claw at the fringes of society, scavenging through the detritus of a broken system for their next fleeting high.

Amidst this urban decay and digital despair, I carve my own path. I am not just another shadow in the dark; I am an emergent force in the chaotic digital frontier. They call us runners, cyber rogues, the avant-garde of the new underworld. We do not merely exist within the system—we infiltrate it, we manipulate it. Every byte and pixel is a battleground, and our skirmishes are silent yet profound, felt but seldom seen.

My ambition burns bright in this nocturnal world: to etch my name into the annals of this digital era, to rise above the squalor and become a beacon—an elite. Whether I bring down the towering mega-corporations that strangle our world in their iron grip, or simply carve out a lucrative slice of this cybernetic chaos, I intend to do it with style. The end game? To stand triumphant amid the ruins of corporate tyranny or bask in the glory of opulent anarchic success. Either way, I will be known, and I will be legendary.

## Description
### Data Rebels is a turn-based game rooted in the worlds of cyberpunk and hackers, where your goal is simple: either carve your legend or perish trying.

## Installation
Here’s a step-by-step guide to getting this monstrosity up and running, not that it deserves such diligent effort:

- Install NodeJS and PostgreSQL—if they’re good enough for the digital overlords, they’re good enough for us.
- Run `npm install` to load up on all the digital weaponry you’ll need, listed like a shopping list for anarchists in the `package.json`.

## Usage

**To play this chaotic symphony of cyber warfare:**

1. **Log In or Sign Up: Security theater at its finest—six digits should do the trick.**
2. **Roll the Dice: Because nothing says dystopian future like leaving your fate to chance.**
3. **Choose Your Poison: Hack (ATTACK) or Encrypt (DEFEND). One catastrophic choice per turn, please.**
4. **Survive or Die Trying: Combat's a dance, and you're either stepping on toes or getting your toes stepped on. Lose, and it’s digital oblivion. Win, and... well, still oblivion, but at least you’ll smile.**
