# Data Rebels

In the sprawling neon-drenched metropolis that most dare to call "The World," the streets seethe with the dispossessed—the nameless drones and disenfranchised souls, each a mere cog in the gargantuan machinery of the omnipotent Corpo conglomerates. These faceless masses slog through their dreary lives, forgotten and downtrodden, while those cast out from even this meager existence claw at the fringes of society, scavenging through the detritus of a broken system for their next fleeting high.

Amidst this urban decay and digital despair, I carve my own path. I am not just another shadow in the dark; I am an emergent force in the chaotic digital frontier. They call us runners, cyber rogues, the avant-garde of the new underworld. We do not merely exist within the system—we infiltrate it, we manipulate it. Every byte and pixel is a battleground, and our skirmishes are silent yet profound, felt but seldom seen.

My ambition burns bright in this nocturnal world: to etch my name into the annals of this digital era, to rise above the squalor and become a beacon—an elite. Whether I bring down the towering mega-corporations that strangle our world in their iron grip, or simply carve out a lucrative slice of this cybernetic chaos, I intend to do it with style. The end game? To stand triumphant amid the ruins of corporate tyranny or bask in the glory of opulent anarchic success. Either way, I will be known, and I will be legendary.

After the random character is assigned to the user, click the play button to start the game.  To play the game click on the hack button on the bottom left, where a usual windows start button would be.  There the user can choose the attack(HACK) or defend (ENCRYPT), only one action is allowed per turn, then the user needs to click on the next turn button and the enemy turn will commence. Combat goes back and forth until either the enemy or user wins. Upon user loss, their account gets deleted and they will have to make a new one to play again.
